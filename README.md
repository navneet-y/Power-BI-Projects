## Power BI Projects Repository: Core Artifacts Collection

Welcome to my central portfolio for Data Analysis and Business Intelligence projects built with Microsoft Power BI.

📂 Repository Content: The Essentials

Every project folder within this repository contains the following fundamental components:

**Power BI Project File:** The primary deliverable containing the complete report, visuals, data model, and all DAX logic.

File Types: Look for the .pbix (single file) or the .pbip (folder structure) file.

**Source Data:** The raw data used to create the report.

Location: The data file (e.g., CSV, Excel) is typically found in a dedicated /Data folder within the project directory. If not, file link will be in readme.

**Documentation:** A project-specific README.md inside each folder, providing context, key insights, and technical notes.

🛠️ Key Skills Used

While each project has unique complexities, the overall repository demonstrates consistent proficiency in:

**Data Transformation (ETL):** Extensive use of Power Query (M Language) for data cleansing, shaping, and combining data sources.

**Data Modeling:** Designing performant data models (often Star Schema) with optimized relationships.

**Advanced Logic:** Implementing complex business calculations and time intelligence using DAX.

**Visualization & UX:** Creating clean, mobile-friendly, and actionable dashboards based on data storytelling principles.
